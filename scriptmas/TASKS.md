### Task: Santa’s Tiling Trouble

Santa is renovating one of the rooms in his workshop! 
You are given the dimensions of the room — its <b>length</b> and <b>width</b>, both in meters, and both whole numbers.

Your job is to calculate <b>how much money Santa must pay</b> for the tiles needed to cover the entire floor.

The price of one square meter of tiles is <b>m2price</b> coins.

But there's a twist! Because elves occasionally drop tiles, break tiles, or use them as sled ramps, 
Santa always buys <b>5% extra tiles</b> to cover possible losses.

<b>Your task:</b> Compute the total amount <b>totalCost</b> Santa needs to pay for all the tiles, including the extra 5%.
