### Santa’s Tiling Trouble

Santa is renovating one of the rooms in his workshop! 
You are given the dimensions of the room — its <b>length</b> and <b>width</b>, both in meters, and both whole numbers.

Your job is to calculate <b>how much money Santa must pay</b> for the tiles needed to cover the entire floor.

The price of one square meter of tiles is <b>m2price</b> coins.

But there's a twist! Because elves occasionally drop tiles, break tiles, or use them as sled ramps, 
Santa always buys <b>5% extra tiles</b> to cover possible losses.

<b>Your task:</b> Compute the total amount <b>totalCost</b> Santa needs to pay for all the tiles, including the extra 5%.

### Santa’s Midnight Clock Countdown

Santa’s magical workshop clock shows <b>x hours</b> and <b>y minutes</b>. 
Write a program that calculates:

- <b>m</b> — how many <b>minutes</b> have passed since midnight
- <b>s</b> — how many <b>seconds</b> have passed since midnight

<b>Example:</b> If the clock shows <b>x = 3</b> and <b>y = 5</b>, then:

- Minutes passed: <b>m = 185</b>
- Seconds passed: <b>s = 11100</b>

Help Santa keep track of time before the Christmas rush begins!
